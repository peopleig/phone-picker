# Phone Picker: A Phone Comparison Tool

This project is a simple web application that compares mobile phones and displays the top 3 based on their total scores. The total scores are decided on the basis of the user's usecase scenarios, which are inputted by them. 

## Features

- Compares mobile phones based on various criteria
- Calculates a total score for each phone
- Displays the top 3 phones with the highest scores

## Files

- `Phone.html`: The main HTML file that displays the top 3 phones
- `SpecsDatabase.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for sorting and displaying the phones

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `Phone.html` in a web browser to view the top 3 phones.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- JavaScript enabled in the browser

## Setup

No additional setup is required. Simply open the HTML file in a web browser.

## How it Works

The application uses a predefined array of mobile phone objects. It sorts these objects based on their total scores and displays the top 3 phones with their details. The total score is based on the priorities input by the user.
The total score is calculated as a linear combination of various specs and their values, which in themselves form a sum, a kind of two layered point system.
